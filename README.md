A spot to store snippets of Python code I've found useful. 

- extract_matches.py: Searches for a pattern in a search object (e.g. Series, DataFrame column), extracts a list of matched entries, and returns: 1. a Series of matched entries, and 2. the search object with the matched entries removed.
- find_entities.py: Determines the type of entities for a DataFrame index containing nouns utilizing Google Natural Language API. (N.B. this requires a prepared environment and an API key to utilize Google's cloud compute functions).
